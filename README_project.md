# Project

In this project we implemented the SWA (Stochastic Weight Averaging) algorithm to gain in generalisation in our models, in application of a project which studies the impact of the background in image classification.



# Files to look at :

See in the folder ```notebooks\``` the files ```Resnet_base.ipynb``` and ``` Resnet_epoch_per_cycle_X.ipynb``` (where ```X``` is the number of epochs per cycle) to see the different trainings.


The first one is for the base_model, which is the starting point of all the other trainings.


To see the exact code of them, look at ```base_training.py``` and ```training.py```, where we have implemented the  algorithm.
